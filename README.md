# Full-Stack
MEAN stack

### Architecture

The project utilizes Express, HTML and JavaScript, to render dynamic pages and handle interactions. Additionally, Angular is implemented for a single-page application (SPA) to provide a responsive UI for a customer-facing interface. The SPA minimized page reloads, enhancing performance and user engagement. The backend uses MongoDB as a database solution for a schema-less NoSQL design primarily for its flexibility.


### Functionality

JSON is a lightweight data format for exchanging information and plays an essential role in communication between the front end and back end. For example, it was used to transmit credentials securely between the SPA and MongoDB-backed API endpoints. 

Throughout the development process, I often had to refactor code to improve maintainability. For instance, minimizing redundancy, optimizing database queries, and encapsulating repetitive tasks. Reusable Angular components are something that helps with maintainability, particularly with UI elements.

### Testing

Endpoints are an essential part of the backend component that enables communication between the frontend and the server. I primarily relied on manually testing endpoints with Postman. The requests used in this application include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Implementing authentication methods limited these requests for non-admin users.


### Reflection

The project was informative and covered various components of full-stack development well. I've gotten more familiar with frameworks like Angular and Bootstrap. One of my main takeaways is learning how to integrate secure authentication mechanisms. Generally, the experience has enhanced my competencies in API development, database management, and modern front-end frameworks.
